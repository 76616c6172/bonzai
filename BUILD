When releasing any new version the following should be immediately
updated to use the latest version so as to not force multiple, redundant
versions of compiled bonzai package to be linked into Bonzai command
tree binaries. The order matters because of interdepdencies:

1.  rwxrob/compcmd
2.  rwxrob/compfile
3.  rwxrob/help
4.  rwxrob/vars
5.  rwxrob/conf
6.  rwxrob/foo
7.  rwxrob/z

(others as needed)

This process has not yet been updated, but should be.
