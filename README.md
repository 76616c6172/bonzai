# Happy Little Command Trees in Go (Think BusyBox)

## "It's spelled 'bonsai'/'banzai'?"

We know. The domains were taken. Plus, this makes it more unique and
easier to find once you know the strange spelling we chose to use. Sorry
if that triggers your OCD.

But, on a lighter note, it just so happens that "banzai" means 'a
traditional Japanese idiom meaning "ten thousand years" of long life,'
a cheer used in celebrations. So combining the notion of a happy,
little, well-manicured, beautiful tree and "ten thousand years of long
life" works out just fine for us.

Then, of course, there's the image of Buckaroo invoked every time we say
the name. In fact, I think we have our new theme song.
